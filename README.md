# WPGraphQL for TEC

This is a essentially a fork of the abandoned [QL Events](https://github.com/the-events-calendar/ql-events). The primary differences are:
- It treats TEC and WPGraphQL like a first class citizen (using TEC functions, data loaders, models, etc).
- It uses PHP 7.4 syntatic sugar.
- It follows emerging best practices in the WPGraphQL ecosystem.

For the above reasons, it was easier to start from scratch and borrow old code than to fork the repo.
